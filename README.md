Results & Insights
.The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with an Highest RÂ² score value.
.Weather conditions and indoor temperature were found to be the most influential factors in energy consumption.
.Feature importance analysis showed that humidity, temperature, and time of day significantly impact energy usage.
.The model struggled to predict sudden energy spikes, suggesting a need for further feature enhancements.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict energy consumption based on environmental and temporal factors. The insights gained can be applied to optimize energy usage in residential or commercial settings. Future improvements could include additional real-time data sources and deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.
